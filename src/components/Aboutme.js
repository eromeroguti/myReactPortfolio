            <p>  Hi there! My name is Edgar Romero, and I'm a beginner software
            developer currently taking a bootcamp to hone my skills. My passion
            for computers started at a young age, and it has only grown stronger
            over the years. I find the field to be incredibly fascinating and
            always full of new challenges to solve. When I'm not coding, you can
            usually find me on a soccer field or out in the great outdoors on an
            overland camping trip. I love the thrill of competition and the
            camaraderie that comes with playing team sports, and camping allows me
            to disconnect from technology and recharge in nature. Music is another
            one of my big interests. I enjoy playing the guitar and listening to
            all kinds of genres, from classic rock to modern hip-hop. But
            ultimately, my heart belongs to computers, and I'm excited to continue
            developing my skills as a software developer.
            </p>
